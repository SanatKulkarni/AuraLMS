## Technologies

*   **Frontend:** React.js
*   **Backend:** Node.js with MySQL database
*   **AI Integration:** [Specify libraries or services used, e.g., OpenAI, TensorFlow, custom AI models, etc.]

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_URL]
    cd AuraLMS
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    *For Frontend*

    ```bash
    cd frontend  # or the relevant directory
    npm install or yarn install
    ```

    *For Backend*

    ```bash
    cd backend # or the relevant directory
    npm install or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configuration:**
    *   Create environment configuration files (.env) in both frontend and backend directories. See `.env.example` for needed variables (e.g., database connection, API keys).
    *   Set up the database:

        *   Create a MySQL database named "auralms".
        *   Run the SQL migration scripts located in backend/migrations to create the required tables.

4.  **Running the Application:**

    *For Frontend*

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start or yarn start
    ```

    *For Backend*

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start or yarn start
    ```

    The application should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` or at the specific port the React and Node.js apps are running on.

## Future Roadmap

*   Expand language offerings in interactive coding modules.
*   Enhance AI-driven learning paths for different skillsets.
*   Integration with video conferencing tools for live classes and interactive sessions.
*   Improved data analytics and reporting on student performance.
